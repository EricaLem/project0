## Contents
I chose the topic of my former business, City Seed Farms. It was a bike-powered urban 
farming business in downtown Toronto.

The project contains a home page, an About Us page, a page listing the crops we grow, 
and a page showcasing pictures from the operations of the business. It uses the Bootstrap 4
library, @media queries, CSS styling, and SCSS variables.

The repository contains:
- four HTML files: homePage.html, aboutUs.html, cropsWeGrow.html, and pictures.html
- a CSS stylesheet: styles.css
- ac SCSS sheet with variables for padding and colour: styles.scss
- a folder of JPG files for the pictures.html page
