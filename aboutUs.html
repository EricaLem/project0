			CITY SEED FARMS is the first bicycle-powered backyard farming business in Toronto. Our team is dedicated to sustainable local food production. We utilize backyards to grow vegetables for local distribution through farmers markets and restaurants. In exchange for the use of residential backyards, the homeowner is delivered a weekly box of produce to their door for the entire growing season. 
		</p>
		<p>
			OUR MISSION is to foster social and environmental change through the production of local, fresh food, and to help teach and inspire people to start growing their own. We employ organic farming methods, use carbon-neutral transportation (all food is delivered by bicycle), and plant heritage seed varieties adapted to Torontoâ€™s unique climate.
		</p>

			In its inaugural year, City Seed Farms received the Heifer International Pass-On-the-Gift grant and won the Project Wildfire social start-up contest, and has been featured in the Toronto Star and on CBC radio twice.
